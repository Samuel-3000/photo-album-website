# gaming-album-website
gaming photo website project for RoboGarden Bootcamp


Hello,

I constructed this website as tribute to some of my favorite video games, that I have put hundreds and hundreds of hours into.
I do not own any of the images or background images present on this site, they are the property of their respective copyright owners. 
I made this site as part of a Web Development Bootcamp with the RoboGarden Learning Platform. 
I hope you enjoy my site 
:)
